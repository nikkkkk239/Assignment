16)Packages Used in the Project

##Backend
1)bcrypt: For password hashing.
2)jsonwebtoken: For user authentication (JWT tokens).
3)dotenv: To manage environment variables.
4)cors: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
5)express: The web framework for building the backend API.
mongoose: For MongoDB object modeling.
cookie-parser: For parsing cookies.
Frontend
@react-google-maps/api: Google Maps integration to select and save locations.
axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
zustand: State management for authentication and address data.
react-icons: For using icons in the UI.
react-hot-toast: For notifications.
react-router-dom: For routing.
react-modal: For handling modals.
State Management with Zustand

This project uses Zustand for state management. Two stores are set up:

useAuthStore: Manages user authentication (sign-up, login, and logout) and stores the userâ€™s data in the app.
useAddressStore: Manages user addresses (Home, Office, Family, etc.) and their interactions with the backend, including adding, updating, and removing addresses. The store also handles recent searches and persists data using Zustand's persist middleware.
Google API Integration

The project enables users to select and save their locations via Google Maps, with options for saving "Home", "Work", or "Family" locations. It provides real-time geolocation tracking, allows users to search for addresses, and stores their recent searches. Users can manage and update their saved locations and set their address preferences.
